1. No flags:
•  Shows commands
•  Asks for confirmations
•  Does not apply changes
2. "-y" only:
•  Shows commands
•  Skips informational confirmations
•  Does not apply changes
•  No implicit switching to apply mode
3. "-a" only:
•  Shows commands
•  Asks for confirmations
•  Applies changes when confirmed
4. "-a -y" together:
•  Shows commands
•  Skips all confirmations
•  Applies all changes automatically

The key improvements are:
1. Clear separation of concerns between display/apply modes
2. No implicit mode switching
3. "-y" only affects confirmations, not execution
4. "-a" is strictly required for any changes
5. Clear feedback about which mode is active
6. Consistent behavior across all combination
